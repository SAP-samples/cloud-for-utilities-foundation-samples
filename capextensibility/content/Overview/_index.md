The SAP Cloud for Utilities Foundation retailer service defines and provides central data storage capabilities for multi-cloud process orchestration for hybrid and cloud system landscapes.

REST APIs are used to create and manage complex utilities orders, incorporate single order items (such as physical products, commodity energy service products, and non-commodity service products), as well as bundle items, which themselves include multiple single products via the Customer Order API.

The SAP Cloud for Utilities Foundation retailer service can receive orders from any commerce system to support the subsequent process steps for fulfilment. Of course, every commerce system could have its own order structure, which means that a mapping to the Cloud for Utilities Foundation retailer service will be needed. However, our API target is to receive the necessary order data in a standardised way. 

The exposure of the Customer Order API allows the creation of orders in the Cloud for Utilities Foundation retailer service. Having the order in this service allows further integration scenarios around orders and enables fulfilment processes, for example via the SAP Workflow Management (WFM) process definition.
