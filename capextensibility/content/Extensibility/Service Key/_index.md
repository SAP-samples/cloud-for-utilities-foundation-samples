## Setup the Service Key

Now that we have created the instance we need to create a service key. With the service key we will be able to create an oauth token that will give us the ability to query our api.

1. From the Instances table, locate the row with our newly created
   instance name and left click the ellipsis (…).

   The following menu will appear:

2. Choose “Create Service Key” and the following dialog will appear:

3. Choose a name for our service key and click “Create”

You could also switch to “Form” View which might be easier to copy the
required information:
